# add a new python file
# Bioinformatics: 
#Recursively find all FASTQ files in a directory and report 
#each file name and the percent of sequences in that file that are greater than 30 nucleotides long. 



#Given a FASTA file with DNA sequences, find 10 most 
#frequent sequences and return the sequence and their counts in the file. 





#Given a chromosome and coordinates, write a program for looking up its annotation. 
# Keep in mind you'll be doing this annotation millions of times.
